# Sample scripts

[Download the sample scripts used in this lab](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872894) 

Copy these scripts to the root of your storage USB drive.  Refer to this page to understand what's in the scripts.

The sample scripts ZIP download includes all the scripts below:

## <span id="Image_deployment_scripts"></span><span id="image_deployment_scripts"></span><span id="IMAGE_DEPLOYMENT_SCRIPTS"></span>Image deployment scripts

The following scripts set up Windows devices by using either a WIM or an FFU image file, and then give the option to configure push-button reset features.

The following files make up the deployment scripts:
- ApplyImage.bat
- ApplyRecovery.bat
- CreatePartitions-BIOS.txt
- CreatePartitions-BIOS-FFU.txt
- CreatePartitions-UEFI.txt
- CreatePartitions-UEFI-FFU.txt
- HideRecoveryPartitions-BIOS.txt
- HideRecoveryPartitions-UEFI.txt
- CreateRecoveryPartitions-BIOS.txt
- CreateRecoveryPartitions-UEFI.txt

### ApplyImage.bat

Use this script applies a Windows image to a new device.

**Note:** If you copy and paste the contents below to create a .bat file, you may get an error when detecting firmware. For firmware detection to succeed, ensure that the lines that begin `for /f "tokens=2* delims=   " %%A` has a tab followed by a space in between `delims=` and `" %%A`.

```
@echo Apply-Image.bat
@echo     Run from the reference device in the WinPE environment.

@echo     This script erases the primary hard drive and applies a new image.

@echo UPDATE (November 2017)
@echo * Added support for FFU deployments.  
@echo.
@echo UPDATE (JULY 2016):
@echo * This script stops just after applying the image.
@echo   This gives you an opportunity to add siloed provisioning packages (SPPs)
@echo   so that you can include them in your recovery tools.
@echo.
@echo   After the script is complete, use apply-recovery.bat to finish
@echo   setting up the recovery tools.

ApplyImage.bat relies on the following DiskPart scripts, which must be placed in the same folder:

### <span id="CreatePartitions-_firmware_.txt"></span>CreatePartitions scripts

Use these scripts together with DiskPart to format and set up the hard disk partitions for Windows, including recovery tools. Adjust the partition sizes to fill the drive as necessary.

#### <span id="CreatePartitions-UEFI.txt"></span> CreatePartitions-UEFI.txt

Creates the System, MSR, Windows, and recovery tools partitions for UEFI-based PCs.

This script temporarily assigns these drive letters: System=S, Windows=W, and Recovery=R. The MSR partition doesn't get a letter. The letter W is used to avoid potential drive letter conflicts. After the device reboots, the Windows partition is assigned the letter C, and the other partitions don’t receive drive letters.

The Recovery partition must be the partition after the Windows partition to ensure winre.wim can be kept up-to-date during life of the device.

The following diagram shows the resulting partition configuration:

#### <span id="CreatePartitions-BIOS.txt"></span> CreatePartitions-BIOS.txt

Creates the System, Windows, and recovery tools partitions for BIOS-based PCs.

This script temporarily assigns these drive letters: System=S, Windows=W, and Recovery=R. The letter W is used to avoid potential drive letter conflicts. After the device reboots, the Windows partition is assigned the letter C, and the other partitions don’t receive drive letters.

The Recovery partition must be the partition after the Windows partition to ensure winre.wim can be kept up-to-date during life of the device.

## <span id="Start_Layout"></span><span id="layoutmodification.xml"></span><span id="LAYOUTMODIFICATION.XML"></span>Start layout (LayoutModification.xml)


The Start tile layout in Windows 10 provides OEMs the ability to append tiles to the default Start layout to include Web links, secondary tiles, Windows apps, and Windows desktop applications. OEMs can use this layout to make it applicable to multiple regions or markets without duplicating a lot of the work. In addition, OEMs can add up to three default apps to the frequently used apps section in the system area, which delivers sytem-driven lists o the user including important or frequently accessed system locations and recently installed apps.

To take advantage of all these new features and have the most robust and complete Start customization experience for Windows 10, consider creating a LayoutModification.xml file. This file specifies how the OEM tiles should be laid out in Start. For more information about how to customize the new Start layout, see the topic [Customize the Windows 10 Start screen](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt170651) in the Windows 10 Partner Documentation.

Add an answer file to the Windows image in C:\\mount\\windows\\Windows\\Panther\\unattend.xml to instruct it to boot into audit mode. You can create this answer file in Windows System Image Manager.

Windows doesn't automatically save settings created through unattend.xml setup files, nor Windows Start Menu customizations created with LayoutModification.xml during a full-system reset, nor first-login info from oobe.xml.

To make sure your customizations are saved, that includes steps to put the unattend.xml, LayoutModification.xml, and oobe.xml files back into place. Here's some sample scripts that show how to retain these settings and put them back into the right spots. Save copies of unattend.xml, LayoutModification.xml, oobe.xml, plus these two text files: ResetConfig.xml and EnableCustomizations.cmd, in C:\\Recovery\\OEM\\:

### ResetConfig.xml

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!-- ResetConfig.xml -->
<Reset>
  <Run Phase="BasicReset_AfterImageApply">
    <Path>EnableCustomizations.cmd</Path>
    <Duration>2</Duration>
  </Run>
  <Run Phase="FactoryReset_AfterImageApply">
    <Path>EnableCustomizations.cmd</Path>
    <Duration>2</Duration>
  </Run>
</Reset>
```

### EnableCustomizations.cmd

```
rem EnableCustomizations.cmd

rem Set the variable %TARGETOS%      (Typically this is C:\Windows)
for /F "tokens=1,2,3 delims= " %%A in ('reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RecoveryEnvironment" /v TargetOS') DO SET TARGETOS=%%C

rem Set the variable %TARGETOSDRIVE% (Typically this is C:)
for /F "tokens=1 delims=\" %%A in ('Echo %TARGETOS%') DO SET TARGETOSDRIVE=%%A

rem Add back Windows settings, Start menu, and OOBE.xml customizations
copy "%TARGETOSDRIVE%\Recovery\OEM\Unattend.xml" "%TARGETOS%\Panther\Unattend.xml" /y
copy "%TARGETOSDRIVE%\Recovery\OEM\LayoutModification.xml" "%TARGETOSDRIVE%\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\LayoutModification.xml" /y
xcopy "%TARGETOSDRIVE%\Recovery\OEM\OOBE\Info" "%TARGETOS%\System32\Info\" /s

rem Recommended: Create a pagefile for devices with 1GB or less of RAM.
wpeutil CreatePageFile /path=%TARGETOSDRIVE%\PageFile.sys /size=256
